quests.dimhopper.default.prologue.0.name=This isnt the overworld...
quests.dimhopper.default.prologue.0.desc=     §fStrange, the realms must be misalligned for you to appear here in §c§8§oLimbo§o§f... Whats that you say? What do I mean by realms? Well you see, your measly plane of existence you like to call the §o§b§b§oOverworld§o§b§f is just one of many, many realms, commonly called§c §oDimensions§o§f...%n%n     Wait, this is no time for an explanation! §o§8§oLimbo §o§fis an empty realm between all other realms! No food to eat, no trees to punch, no resources to mine... Normally, you would be stuck here for all eternity with no way back. %n%n     But luckily for you, I might be able to help you escape! I only need you to gather a few things before I can send you off. %n%n     A few things to note about §8§oLimbo§o§f, however. First of all you §4cannot take fall damage§f here. Second of all, watch out for §4monoliths§f that inhabit this place. While they cannot damage you, they will §4§f§4teleport §fyou up into a different location if you stay too close to them, making it more difficult to leave this dimension.%n%n     I should be able to call some things across dimensions to ensure your survival for now, but its best not to stay here for too long.
quests.dimhopper.default.prologue.1.name=Strange Fabric
quests.dimhopper.default.prologue.1.desc=     I was able to bring you your favorite mining tool, a §a§opickaxe§o§f. Happy? Well luckily this one has a special §a§osilk touch§o§f enchantment that you will most definitely need. I noticed the §8§7§oUnraveld Fabric§o§f that is the constitution of this place has a rather unique property. If you mine some of it up with that handy pickaxe I got for you, we should be able to make something with it to escape.%n%n     But be careful! Transporting across dimensions is not an exact science, so the pickaxe I got for you has a rather low §o§c§odurability §o§fvalue. Do not go wasting it, because I will not be able to get another one.
quests.dimhopper.default.prologue.2.name=Fabric of Reality
quests.dimhopper.default.prologue.2.desc=     With that§7 §oUnraveled Fabric§o§f you got, you can make some §0§o§5§oFabric of Reality§o§f. Think of this as a one time favor, but if you give me 2 of those, it should be enough to send you back to your own realm.
quests.dimhopper.default.prologue.3.name=A Rough start
quests.dimhopper.default.prologue.3.desc=     This can't be... was there an error in my calculations? This may look like your §o§3§b§oOverworld§f§o§o§r§f, but it is one of many mirror realms. In any case, it seems we have a much bigger problem than I thought. §c§oSomething§r§f must have somehow scrambled the realms.%n%n     Hey, you know what? I did you a pretty big favor getting you out of §8§oLimbo§r§f, so now it's your turn to repay the favor. Investigate the cause of the apparent §4§6§o§m§m§l§m§r§o§l§6§o§lDimensional Shift§r§f for me. To that end, you probably have a long journey ahead of you, so I guess I can guide you along the way.%n%n     Your first task is to explore this realm. There must be a clue around here somewhere. Punching trees is always a good place to start.
quests.dimhopper.default.bosses.4.name=Naga
quests.dimhopper.default.bosses.4.desc=     Your first encounter with a strong monster. A shield will help in defeating this annoying snake.%n%n§c§lHint:§r§c Wait for the naga to pause. This means it is getting ready to charge at you! This is when you should raise your shield, since that is how you stun it. There is also an audio cue for when it charges.%n%n§3§lNote: All boss quests can be completed by killing the boss OR collecting the drop. This is due to kill tasks not properly syncing for offline players in multiplayer. However, certain drops may also be obtainable by other means...

quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.6.name=The Overworld!
quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.6.desc=     It appears the §6§l§oDimension Shift§r is causing more problems than anticipated. That portal gateway behind you leading to the twilight realm will most likely not work anymore. Other realms and methods of travel to them may also be affected, so be wary.%n%n     Anyways, now that we are in the realm you are used to, we can finally start branching out and looking for the root of the issue. But first, some §a§r§fway of processing the materials you find is in order, as the method you may be familiar with has been lost between dimensions.

quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.82.name=Prepping for an Excursion
quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.82.desc=     Well, have you gotten nice and settled in yet? Either way it does not matter because it is time for you to investigate other realms. The closest ones from this one happen to be the§4§o Nether§r and the §e§o§r§9§oAether§r, so that is where we will start! %n%n     Although do take caution, because it seems normal §d§oportal§r structures will be more difficult to activate due to the §l§o§6§l§oDimensional Shift§r. Luckily, the §4§oNether§r happens to be right below this realm, so that can be worked around by digging down to bedrock and throwing an enderpearl through. There are some §o§r§oweird factors§r at play here regarding that, but its best that you dont worry about it too much (§c§oright click bedrock with enderpearl§r). §rGetting back to the overworld should work in the same way (§c§oexcept you left click the bedrock with an enderpearl instead§r), although where you will end up is not quite an exact science at this point. %n%n     As for the §e§o§9§oAether§r, I think the original inhabitants were able to create some sort of §2§oteleporter§r after the portals stopped functioning. You should be able to do the same.%n%n§3§lNOTE: §oInfernal (named) mobs have a high chance of dropping 1 or more ender pearls, so you will not get stuck in the nether.%n%n§r§3§lADDITIONAL NOTE: §oNether portals can still be made, but they require compressed obsidian of any level or refined obsidian blocks instead of normal obsidian. Portals can have multiple types of obsidian in the frame
quests.dimhopper.default.storage.83.name=Store your Items
quests.dimhopper.default.storage.83.desc=     A good way to start storing your items is putting them in a chest! However, I would §onot§r recommend storing items in an unstable realm, becuase you never know how long you will be able to access that realm.

quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.84.desc=     It seems the original inhabitants of the §e§oAether§r were able to construct a device to travel between realms without the help of a portal structure. Actually, it seems a rather simple task to create one, too.

quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.86.desc=     It seems the only ores here are the ones native to the §e§oAether§r. You should consider yourself fortunate here, that these did not get switched in the §6§o§lDimensional Shift§r

quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.88.name=Aether Mobs
quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.88.desc=     The strange creatures here are really not that special in terms of what we need. But if we gather some materials from them, we should be able to use it with what we gather in the §c§oNether§r.
quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.89.name=Star Shaped Key
quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.89.desc=     I found it! What we need to get is a §4§5§oNether Star§r. When combining this with what we found in the §e§oAether§r, you should be able to make it to your next destination. However, the only way to obtain one at the moment, is to defeat the §8§oWither§r, a powerful monster that can be summoned with 3 §8§oWither Skeleton Skulls§r.
quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.90.name=Unique blocks
quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.90.desc=     There seem to be 2 useful block type here, but for very different purposes. The §9§o§rproperties of the §o§b§oCold Aercloud§r§r will help us make what we need, while the§a§7 §oQuicksoil§r allows you to run at very high speeds. Gather both of those and we should be on our way. I do not like the idea of staying in one place for too long...

quests.dimhopper.default.processing.103.name=I dont like where this is going...
quests.dimhopper.default.processing.103.desc=     That blast furnace is nice and all, but it is very slow. I suppose our next goal should be the §5§osmeltery§r. But first, we need a lot of seared bricks...

Well luckily for you, it seems like §d§oPixies§r are a lower form of these §5§oPixons§r and can be specially transumuted into them! The type of §5§oPixon§r that spawns is dependent on which realm you perform the transmutation in, but be warned that performing the transmutation in a realm that does not naturally house any §5§oPixon§r varients will result in a failure and a waste of a §d§oPixie§r.%n%n§4§lNote: The only way to get a pixie to spawn is by dealing 50 or more damage with an Elementium Sword.

quests.dimhopper.default.chapter1.190.desc=     Have you noticed any strange looking §1§odoors§r around?

The power that this item holds seems to have a keen desire to interact with the local vegetation. I would imagine having it interact with a sapling could provide very §ointeresting§r results, but as usual, the §6§l§oDimensional Shift§r seems to be blocking its potential.

Here is some information on how to level them up and some passive benefits they provide.

The harvest level and hardness value of the block broken affects how much SP is actually gained. Blocks with a harvest level of 0 have a small chance of counting as harvest level 1, which increases as the mining skill is leveled up. Coal ore always counts as harvest level 1 to make leveling up easier in the prologue%n%n§lResearch§r: +5 for every advancement completed.
